/*How to use GÄ°T/GitHUB

1-You need to work with latest code, That's why we need to be in the main
2-You need to "pull" the latest code from server to your laptop

After getting the latest code;

-Create a new branch. Git -> create a meaningful name.
-Then, do some changes and when we finish, we need to commit and push our changes to server(GitHub)
-Then, we create a "Pull Request"
-Someone needs to approve my pull request so I can merge my changes.
-As soon as we merge our changes, it will be seen in the main branch
